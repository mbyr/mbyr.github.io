I am an Assistant Professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences and a Research Scientist at Samsung AI Center. Prior to that, I was a Research Fellow at RIKEN, Wako, Japan and a Postdoc at University of California San Diego, USA. 

I obtained my PhD (cum laude) and DSc degrees at the Polish Academy of Sciences. 

# Research

My research interests evolve over time but are always related to neural networks, biomedical image analysis (radiology & neuroscience) and image processing. I work on a variety of topics, including:

* biomedical image classification, segmentation and registration
* computational ultrasound imaging and quantitative ultrasound (liver, breast, nerve) 
* transfer learning with deep networks 
* implicit neural networks (representing biomedical data, learning in deep weight spaces)
* zero-shot methods (VLMs, LLMs) 
* explainability and robustness in AI
