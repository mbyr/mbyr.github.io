I am an Assistant Professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences and a Research Scientist at the Samsung AI Center. Previously, I was a Research Fellow at RIKEN, Wako, Japan and a Postdoc at the University of California, San Diego, USA. 

I obtained my PhD (cum laude) and DSc degrees at the Polish Academy of Sciences. 

# Research

My research interests evolve over time but are always related to neural networks, biomedical image analysis (radiology and neuroscience) and image processing. I work on a variety of topics, including:

* biomedical image classification, segmentation and registration
* computational medical imaging and quantitative ultrasound (e.g. liver, breast, nerve) 
* transfer learning in deep neural networks 
* implicit neural representations
* computer vision, vision-language models and video understanding

# For Students

A beginning is a very delicate time... I am always open to working with motivated students. If you are interested in an internship or working on a thesis related to neural networks or biomedical image analysis, feel free to reach out! :)
