I am an Assistant Professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences and a Research Scientist at Samsung AI Center. Prior to that, I was a Research Fellow at RIKEN, Wako, Japan and a Postdoc at University of California San Diego, USA. 

I obtained my PhD (cum laude) and DSc degrees at the Polish Academy of Sciences.
